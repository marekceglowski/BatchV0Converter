BatchV0Converter
================

This program batch converts mp3 files from 320 kbps to V0.

Instructions:

1. Download the zip file in the "Compiled" folder.

2. Extract anywhere on your computer.

3. Run BatchV0Converter.exe and follow the instructions given.

How it works:

Basically it just takes a folder, finds all the mp3 files in it (and subfolders)
and makes a list of the 320 kbps ones. Then it converts them using LAME and places
them into <your folder>\converted\ with the same subfolder structure and ID3 tags
in place.

Enjoy!!

The program isn't really robust or anything, just a quick script I made since
I couldn't find anything online that also checked subfolders and kept them
in the same format. It helped me save some space on my phone without having
to delete some albums (since it was getting full from all the music on it).
